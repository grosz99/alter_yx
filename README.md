[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/grosz99/alter_yx)

> ⚠️ **Beta Software**: Pycture is currently in beta. See [Privacy & Security](#privacy--security) for data handling details.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**[Add your Netlify URL here after deployment]**

## 📋 What It Does

Pycture uses AI (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT-4) to convert Alteryx workflow descriptions into clean, well-documented Python scripts using pandas. Simply describe your Alteryx workflow, and get production-ready Python code instantly.

### Features

- 🤖 **Dual AI Support**: Choose between Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet or OpenAI GPT-4
- 📁 **Smart File Analysis**: Upload CSV/Excel files (up to 100MB) for metadata extraction
- 📋 **Step-by-Step Workflow**: See each transformation with corresponding code
- 🐍 **Clean Python Code**: Well-commented, production-ready pandas scripts
- 🔒 **Bring Your Own Key**: Use your own API key (see privacy details below)
- ⬇️ **Easy Export**: Download scripts or copy to clipboard

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Get an Anthropic API Key**
   Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an API key

2. **Visit the App**
   Go to the live deployment URL

3. **Enter Your API Key**
   Paste your Anthropic API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

4. **Upload Files** (optional)
   Upload CSV/Excel files for context

5. **Describe Your Workflow**
   Example: "Load sales.csv, filter for amounts over $1000, join with customers.csv on customer_id, calculate total revenue by region, and save to Excel"

6. **Generate & Download**
   Click "Generate Python Script" and download your code!

## 📝 Common Alteryx Tool Mappings

| Alteryx Tool | Python Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Input Data | `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_excel()` |
| Output Data | `df.to_csv()`, `df.to_excel()` |
| Filter | `df[condition]` |
| Select | `df[['col1', 'col2']]` |
| Join | `pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key')` |
| Union | `pd.concat([df1, df2])` |
| Formula | `df['new'] = calculation` |
| Summarize | `df.groupby().agg()` |
| Sort | `df.sort_values()` |
| Unique | `df.drop_duplicates()` |
| Cross Tab | `pd.pivot_table()` |
| Data Cleansing | `str.strip()`, `str.upper()`, `fillna()` |

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Client-side API key**: Your Anthropic API key is sent directly to Anthropic, never stored on our servers
- **Input validation**: File type and size restrictions (CSV/Excel, max 10MB)
- **Sanitized inputs**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Serverless proxy**: CORS-safe proxy prevents direct browser-to-API calls
- **No backend storage**: No databases, no data persistence

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to parse Claude response as JSON"
- Open browser console (F12) to see the raw response
- The AI prompt has been optimized to return pure JSON
- If issue persists, try simplifying your workflow description

### "CORS error" or "Failed to fetch"
- Make sure the Netlify deployment completed successfully
- Check that the serverless function deployed correctly
- Try refreshing the page

### "Invalid API key"
- Verify your Anthropic API key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Get a new key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### How Your Data is Handled

- **API Keys**: Your API key is sent **directly from your browser** to Anthropic/OpenAI via HTTPS. We never see, receive, or log your API key. It stays in your browser memory only.

- **File Uploads**: Files are processed **entirely in your browser**. Only metadata (column names, row count from first 50KB) is extracted. Full file contents never leave your device.

- **Prompts & Code**: Your workflow descriptions are sent directly to the AI provider. Generated code is received directly in your browser. **Nothing passes through our servers.**

- **No Tracking**: We do not use analytics, cookies, or tracking pixels. Your usage is completely private.

### Security Measures

- ✅ **Direct API Calls**: No proxy - your key goes straight to Anthropic/OpenAI
- ✅ **Client-Side Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per minute protection
- ✅ **Enhanced Prompt Injection Detection**: Unicode normalization, 12+ pattern checks
- ✅ **AI Output Validation**: Blocks dangerous code imports (os, subprocess, etc.)
- ✅ **HTTPS Encryption**: All communications encrypted end-to-end
- ✅ **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers protect against XSS
- ✅ **No Data Persistence**: We don't store anything - ever

### Architecture

```
Your Browser → Direct HTTPS → Anthropic/OpenAI API
     ↑                              ↓
     └────────── Response ──────────┘

(Our servers never involved - fully client-side!)
